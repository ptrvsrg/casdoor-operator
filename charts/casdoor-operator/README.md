<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project <a id='about-the-project'></a>

Simply put, the Casdoor Operator is a tool for automating the resource management of Casdoor instances in Kubernetes
environments.

Casdoor is an open-source identity and access management platform that provides authentication, authorization, and user
management capabilities. Managing Casdoor deployments manually in Kubernetes can be repetitive, error-prone, and
time-consuming. This is where the Casdoor Operator comes in to streamline the process.

### Why We Built It <a id='why-we-built-it'></a>

The Casdoor Operator was created to solve a common problem faced by developers and DevOps teams: deploying and managing
applications in Kubernetes is complex and often tedious. Without automation, you end up writing custom scripts or
performing manual steps to handle tasks like provisioning, configuration, scaling, and health checks.

Typically, these scripts are not reusable, difficult to maintain, and often depend on multiple tools, making it hard to
replicate the process across different environments. The Casdoor Operator eliminates the need for these custom solutions
by providing a robust, reusable, and Kubernetes-native way to manage Casdoor instances.

With the Casdoor Operator, instead of writing complex scripts or manually managing deployments, you define your desired
state in a simple custom resource definition (CRD) file. The operator takes care of the rest, ensuring that your Casdoor
instances are deployed, configured, and maintained according to your specifications.

### How It Helps <a id='how-it-helps'></a>

We have worked hard to make the Casdoor Operator intuitive and powerful, focusing on simplicity, security, and
scalability. Here’s how it benefits users:

* **Automation:** Simplifies the deployment and lifecycle management of Casdoor instances.
* **Consistency:** Ensures consistent configurations across environments using Kubernetes-native tools.
* **Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the health of Casdoor instances and updates their status accordingly.
* **Extensibility:** Provides flexibility to customize deployments based on your specific needs.
* **Security:** Supports secure practices such as secret management and signed artifacts.

Our goal is to empower users to focus on building great applications while the Casdoor Operator handles the operational
complexities of managing Casdoor in Kubernetes.
